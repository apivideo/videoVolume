# videoVolume

Try this demo out at:
volumewarning.a.video

This demo uses the api.video player SDK to monitor the volume of the video, and based on the volume, the background colour of the page is altered. (You could warn your users if the volume is too high, or similar).

Simple HTML & JS to make it all happen.
